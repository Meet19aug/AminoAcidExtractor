# AminoAcidExtractor

**Effortlessly extract amino acid data from PDFs with advanced AI-powered tools.**

## Project Overview
AminoAcidExtractor is a collaborative project aimed at simplifying the process of extracting structured amino acid data from PDF files. Initially utilizing Camelot for table extraction, we are now transitioning to LlamaIndex for better performance, scalability, and accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Advanced Parsing**: Transition from Camelot to LlamaIndex for state-of-the-art AI-powered document parsing.
- **Flask Frontend**: Interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Wide File Support**: Parse PDFs, PowerPoints, Word documents, and spreadsheets into structured data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle complex datasets with ease.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flask
- **Backend Parsing Library**: 
  - Initial: Camelot (PDF Table Extraction for Humans)
  - Upgraded: LlamaIndex (AI-driven document parsing)

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AminoAcidExtractor.git
